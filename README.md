This is a recipe page project that will be built as part of The Odin Project course.

I am going to be using nothing else but an IDE & Terminal to build the page, as I want to practice the efficiency of Terminal while using the mouse as little as possible.

Sep 18 - The start of the project. Focus on HTML structure.
